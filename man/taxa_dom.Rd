\usage{
taxa_dom(
  long.df,
  unique.id.col,
  count.col,
  taxon.col,
  dom.level,
  unnest.cols = data
)
}
\arguments{
\item{long.df}{Taxonomic counts arranged in a long data format.}

\item{unique.id.col}{The name of the column that contains a unique sampling
event ID.}

\item{count.col}{The name of the column that contains taxanomic counts.}

\item{dom.level}{A numeric value, typically 1-5, the number of dominant
used during the calculation.}

\item{taxon.cols}{The name of the column(s) that contains the taxa
of interest.}
}
\value{
Percent of individuals that represent the most abundant taxon or taxa.
dom.level can be used to specify 1st-5th most abundant taxa by specifying
the corresponding numeric value (1-5).  Values >1 include all of the previous
dominance levels. For example, dom.level = 3 is the percentage of the most
dominant taxon, the second most dominant taxon, and the third most
dominant taxon. During calculation the taxa are ranked in descending order.
If there are two taxa with the same count at the specified dom.level, only
one taxon is used. Consider the following vector as an example of
taxonomic counts: c(10, 10, 5, 2, 2, 1). If dom.level == 1, only the first
"10" is selected. If dom.level == 2, the first two "10"s are selected.

This measure is related to taxa evenness. Typically
degradation is associated with elevated levels of the
most dominant taxon (taxa); therefore, this metric typically increases
with degradation.
